In the top left you will see a settings menu if you want to click at anytime after the main menu. 
If you want to click the roulette table or the slots machines you can start playing. Right now the operational games are roulette and slots. BlackJack did not get into the 1.0 release. 
 Right now, all the bet conditions are in and working, and you can spin as many times as you want, and you can bet as much as you want. 
Do not be alarmed, the "stop" and "restart" buttons are on a delay so that there is no cheating. They will take a couple a couple seconds to start and stop.
 THE PAYOUT SYSTEM ON ROULETTE IS DELAYED. DON'T BE ALARMED IF THE BALANCE GETS UPDATED ON THE FOLLOWING SPIN OR AFTER.
